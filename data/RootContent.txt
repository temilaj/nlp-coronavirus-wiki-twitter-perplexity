disease       COVID     is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV     The first case was identified in Wuhan  China  in December       The disease has since spread worldwide  leading to an ongoing pandemic  Symptoms of COVID    are variable  but often include fever  cough  fatigue  breathing difficulties  and loss of smell and taste  Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus  Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms  most       develop mild to moderate symptoms  up to mild pneumonia   while     develop severe symptoms  dyspnea  hypoxia  or more than     lung involvement on imaging   and    suffer critical symptoms  respiratory failure  shock  or multiorgan dysfunction      At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus remain asymptomatic and do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time  but they still can spread the disease        Some people continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months after recovery  and damage to organs has been observed     Multi year studies are underway to further investigate the long term effects of the disease     The virus that causes COVID    spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact a  with another person          Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an infected persons nose and mouth as they breathe  cough  sneeze  sing  or speak  Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth  nose or eyes  The virus may also spread via contaminated surfaces  although this is not thought to be the main route of transmission      The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively      but infection mainly happens when people are near each other for long enough  People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms  as can people who do not experience symptoms  People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to    days in severe cases      Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease  The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus nucleic acid by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT PCR   transcription mediated amplification  TMA   or by loop mediated isothermal amplification from a nasopharyngeal swab  Preventive measures include physical or social distancing  quarantining  ventilation of indoor spaces  covering coughs and sneezes  hand washing  and keeping unwashed hands away from the face  The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions  Several vaccines have been developed and several countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns  Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus  the primary treatment is currently symptomatic  Management involves

include headache  loss of smell and taste  nasal congestion and rhinorrhea  cough  muscle pain  sore throat  fever  diarrhea  and breathing difficulties      People with the same infection may have different symptoms  and their symptoms may change over time  Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified  one respiratory symptom cluster with cough  sputum  shortness of breath  and fever  a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain  headache  and fatigue  a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain  vomiting  and diarrhea      In people without prior ears  nose  and throat disorders  loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID         Most people       develop mild to moderate symptoms  up to mild pneumonia   while     develop severe symptoms  dyspnea  hypoxia  or more than     lung involvement on imaging  and    of patients suffer critical symptoms  respiratory failure  shock  or multiorgan dysfunction       At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time                  These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease                  Other infected people will develop symptoms later  called  pre symptomatic   or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus      As is common with infections  there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms  The median delay for COVID    is four to five days      Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure  and almost all will experience at least one symptom within    days           Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease  However  some people continue to experience a range of effects for months after recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs has been observed  Multi year studies are underway to further investigate the long term effects of the disease      Cause COVID    is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV    virus strain   Transmission Main article  Transmission of COVID     Transmission of COVID     Coronavirus disease       COVID     spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs  sneezes  sings  talks or breathes          A new infection occurs when virus containing particles exhaled by an infected person  either respiratory droplets or aerosols  get into the mouth  nose  or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person      During human to human transmission  an average      infectious SARS CoV   virions are thought to initiate a new infection          The closer people interact  and the longer they interact  the more likely they are to transmit COVID     Closer distances can involve larger droplets  which fall to the ground  and aerosols  whereas longer distances only involve aerosols      Larger droplets can also turn into aerosols  known as droplet nuclei  through evaporation      The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November       however  the virus is not known to spread between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts      Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors  in high risk locations     such as restaurants  choirs  gyms  nightclubs  offices  and religious venues  often when they are crowded or less ventilated      It also occurs in healthcare settings  often when aerosol generating medical procedures are performed on COVID    patients      Although it is considered possible there is no direct evidence of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin contact      A person could get COVID    indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object before touching their own mouth  nose  or eyes  though this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads      The virus is not known to spread through feces  urine  breast milk  food  wastewater  drinking water  or via animal disease vectors  although some animals can contract the virus from humans   It very rarely transmits from mother to baby during pregnancy      Social distancing and the wearing of cloth face masks  surgical masks  respirators  or other face coverings are controls for droplet transmission  Transmission may be decreased indoors with well maintained heating and ventilation systems to maintain good air circulation and increase the use of outdoor air      The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies      Coronavirus disease      is more infectious than influenza  but less so than measles  It often spreads in clusters  where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location      There is a major role of  super spreading events   where many people are infected by one person          A person who is infected can transmit the virus to others up to two days before they themselves show symptoms  and even if symptoms never appear      People remain infectious in moderate cases for  –   days  and up to two weeks in severe cases      In October       medical scientists reported evidence of reinfection in one person           Virology Main article  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus   Illustration of SARSr CoV virion Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV    is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan      All structural features of the novel SARS CoV   virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature      Outside the human body  the virus is destroyed by household soap  which bursts its protective bubble      SARS CoV   is closely related to the original SARS CoV      It is thought to have an animal  zoonotic  origin  Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus  in subgenus Sarbecovirus  lineage B  together with two bat derived strains  It is     identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples  BatCov RaTG             The structural proteins of SARS CoV   include membrane glycoprotein  M   envelope protein  E   nucleocapsid protein  N   and the spike protein  S   The M protein of SARS CoV   is about     similar to the M protein of bat SARS CoV  maintains around     homology with pangolin SARS CoV  and has     homology with the M protein of SARS CoV  whereas  the similarity is only around     with the M protein of MERS CoV  The structure of the M protein resembles the sugar transporter SemiSWEET      The many thousands of SARS CoV   variants are grouped into clades      Several different clade nomenclatures have been proposed  Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades    A    B    A    B  and   C   while GISAID divides them into seven  L  O  V  S  G  GH  and GR       Several notable variants of SARS CoV   emerged in late       Cluster   emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark  After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign  it is believed to have been eradicated  The Variant of Concern            VOC            is believed to have emerged in the United Kingdom in September  The    Y V  Variant  which has the same N   Y mutation  arose independently in South Africa           SARS CoV   variants Main article  Variants of SARS CoV   Three known variants of COVID    are currently spreading among global populations as of January      including the UK Variant  referred to as B        first found in London and Kent  a variant discovered in South Africa  referred to as         and a variant discovered in Brazil  referred to as P         Using Whole Genome Sequencing  epidemiology and modelling suggest the new UK variant ‘VUI –          ’  the first Variant Under Investigation in December       transmits more easily than other strains       Pathophysiology  COVID    pathogenesis COVID    can affect the upper respiratory tract  sinuses  nose  and throat  and the lower respiratory tract  windpipe and lungs       The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID    because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE    which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs      The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a  spike   peplomer  to connect to ACE  and enter the host cell      The density of ACE  in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and decreasing ACE  activity might be protective      though another view is that increasing ACE  using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective      As the alveolar disease progresses  respiratory failure might develop and death may follow      Whether SARS CoV   is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown  The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID    people with neurological issues  However  SARS CoV   has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID     but these results need to be confirmed      SARS CoV   could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS  While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies  the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE  in the brain              The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood brain barrier to gain access to the CNS  possibly within an infected white blood cell        Tropism and multiple organ injuries in SARS CoV   infection The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE  is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric  duodenal and rectal epithelium     as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine      The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system      An acute cardiac injury was found in     of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan  China      and is more frequent in severe disease      Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high  owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression  but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE  receptors in the heart      ACE  receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function          A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found people transferred to Intensive care unit  ICU  with COVID    infections  and may be related to poor prognosis      Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation  as suggested by high D dimer levels caused by blood clots  are thought to play a significant role in mortality  incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms  and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS CoV    Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body  constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia      Furthermore  microvascular blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brains – without detected SARS CoV   – and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID                 Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys      Early reports show that up to     of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys  including some persons with no previous kidney problems      Autopsies of people who died of COVID    have found diffuse alveolar damage  and lymphocyte containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung       Immunopathology  Key components of the adaptive immune response to SARS CoV    Although SARS CoV   has a tropism for ACE  expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract  people with severe COVID    have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation  Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL    IL    IL    granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor  GM CSF   interferon γ inducible protein     IP      monocyte chemoattractant protein    MCP     macrophage inflammatory protein   α  MIP  α   and tumour necrosis factor α  TNF α  indicative of cytokine release syndrome  CRS  suggest an underlying immunopathology      Additionally  people with COVID    and acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  have classical serum biomarkers of CRS  including elevated C reactive protein  CRP   lactate dehydrogenase  LDH   D dimer  and ferritin      Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation  allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart  In particular  pathogenic GM CSF secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL   secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID          Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy       Viral and host factors Virus proteins  The association between SARS CoV   and the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System  RAAS   Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus  The S protein  otherwise known as the spike protein  is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE  receptors  It includes two subunits  S  and S   S  determines the virus host range and cellular tropism via the receptor binding domain  S  mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H  and HR   which are heptad repeat regions  Studies have shown that S  domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity  It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID    vaccines      The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients  It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope      The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the hosts immune response       Host factors Human angiotensin converting enzyme    hACE   is the host factor that SARS COV  virus targets causing COVID     Theoretically the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers  ARB  and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE  expression might increase morbidity with COVID     though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB  However no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes  Until further data is available  guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain      The virus effect on ACE  cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration  increased blood vessel permeability  alveolar wall permeability  as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants  These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms  However  the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome       Host cytokine response  Mild versus severe immune response during virus infection The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm      Levels of interleukin  B  interferon gamma  interferon inducible protein     and monocyte chemoattractant protein   were all associated with COVID    disease severity  Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID    disease      A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID     it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality  The storm causes the acute respiratory distress syndrome  blood clotting events such as strokes  myocardial infarction  encephalitis  acute kidney injury  and vasculitis   The production  of IL    IL    IL    TNF alpha  and interferon gamma  all crucial components of normal immune responses  inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm  The cells of the central nervous system  the microglia  neurons  and astrocytes  are also be involved in the release of pro inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system  and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon       Diagnosis Further information  COVID    testingCOVID    can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions          Along with laboratory testing  chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID    in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection      Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests  which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection      Viral testing Main article  COVID    testing  Demonstration of a nasopharyngeal swab for COVID    testing The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS CoV   are nucleic acid tests          which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments      As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus  its  ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited       The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab  however  a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used           Results are generally available within hours      The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease       A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests  which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection  Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK       The University of Oxfords CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence           that  a good proportion of new mild cases and people re testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious  but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with  and have called for  an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing       On   September  the UK government issued  guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS CoV   RNA results during periods of low prevalence  when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results         Imaging  A CT scan of a person with COVID    shows lesions  bright regions  in the lungs   CT scan of rapid progression stage of COVID      Chest X ray showing COVID    pneumonia  Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID    in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening           Bilateral multilobar ground glass opacities with a peripheral  asymmetric  and posterior distribution are common in early infection           Subpleural dominance  crazy paving  lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling   and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses           Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography  CT  of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities without pleural effusions       Many groups have created COVID    datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases       Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus  imaging without confirmation by rRT PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID          A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection  it is faster and more sensitive       Coding In late       the WHO assigned emergency ICD    disease codes U     for deaths from lab confirmed SARS CoV   infection and U     for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID    without lab confirmed SARS CoV   infection        Pathology The main pathological findings at autopsy are       Macroscopy  pericarditis  lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema Lung findings  minor serous exudation  minor fibrin exudation pulmonary oedema  pneumocyte hyperplasia  large atypical pneumocytes  interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation diffuse alveolar damage  DAD  with diffuse alveolar exudates  DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  and severe hypoxemia  organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis plasmocytosis in BAL      Blood  disseminated intravascular coagulation  DIC        leukoerythroblastic reaction      Liver  microvesicular steatosis Prevention Further information  COVID    vaccine  Workplace hazard controls for COVID     Pandemic prevention  preparations prior to COVID     COVID    surveillance  and COVID    apps  Infographic by the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   describing how to stop the spread of germs Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home  wearing a mask in public  avoiding crowded places  keeping distance from others  ventilating indoor spaces  washing hands with soap and water often and for at least    seconds  practising good respiratory hygiene  and avoiding touching the eyes  nose  or mouth with unwashed hands            Those diagnosed with COVID    or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care  call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider  wear a face mask before entering the healthcare providers office and when in any room or vehicle with another person  cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue  regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items            The first COVID    vaccine was granted regulatory approval on   December by the UK medicines regulator MHRA       It was evaluated for emergency use authorization  EUA  status by the US FDA  and in several other countries       Initially  the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID     before or after exposure to the SARS CoV   virus  outside the setting of a clinical trial            Without a vaccine  other prophylactic measures  or effective treatments  a key part of managing COVID    is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak  known as  flattening the curve        This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed  allowing for better treatment of current cases  and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available             Vaccine Main article  COVID    vaccine  Different vaccine candidate types in development for SARS CoV    A COVID‑   vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‑CoV‑    the virus causing coronavirus disease       COVID‑     Prior to the COVID‑   pandemic  work to develop a vaccine against coronavirus diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  and Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses  this knowledge enabled accelerated development of various vaccine technologies during early            On    January       the SARS CoV   genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID  and by    March  the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID          As of February      update      vaccine candidates are in clinical research  including    in Phase I trials     in Phase I–II trials    in Phase II trials  and    in Phase III trials       Trials for four other candidates were terminated       In Phase III trials  several COVID‑   vaccines demonstrate efficacy as high as     in preventing symptomatic COVID‑   infections  As of February      update   eleven vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use  two RNA vaccines  the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine   four conventional inactivated vaccines  BBIBP CorV  Covaxin  CoronaVac and CoviVac   four viral vector vaccines  Sputnik V  the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine  Convidicea  and the Johnson   Johnson vaccine   and one peptide vaccine  EpiVacCorona         Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications  such as the elderly  and those at high risk of exposure and transmission  such as healthcare workers       As of    February      update          million doses of COVID‑   vaccine have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies       Pfizer  Moderna  and AstraZeneca predicted a manufacturing capacity of     billion doses in       which could be used to vaccinate about   billion people  as the vaccines require two doses for a protective effect against COVID‑     By December       more than    billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries       with about half of the doses purchased by high income countries comprising     of the worlds population       Social distancing Main article  Social distancing measures related to the COVID    pandemic  Without pandemic containment measures—such as social distancing  vaccination  and use of face masks—pathogens can spread exponentially       This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population  Social distancing  also known as physical distancing  includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals  Methods include quarantines  travel restrictions  and the closing of schools  workplaces  stadiums  theatres  or shopping centres  Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home  limiting travel  avoiding crowded areas  using no contact greetings  and physically distancing themselves from others       Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak       Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing            In the United States  the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID    due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease  and poor access to high quality healthcare        Self isolation Self isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID    and those who suspect they have been infected  Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self isolation       Many governments have mandated or recommended self quarantine for entire populations  The strongest self quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups       Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID    and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self quarantine for    days from the time of last possible exposure  citation needed   Face masks and respiratory hygiene Main article  Face masks during the COVID    pandemic  Masks with an exhalation valve  The valves are a weakpoint that can transmit the viruses outwards  The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain            This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing            Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking  breathing  and coughing            A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air  reducing the chances of infection       But  if the mask include an exhalation valve  a wearer that is infected  maybe without having noticed that  and asymptomatic  would transmit the virus outwards through it  despite any certification they can have  So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers  and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale  Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus       Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease       When not wearing a mask  the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available  Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged  Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID    are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH certified N   or equivalent  in addition to other personal protective equipment        Hand washing and hygiene Main article  Hand washing Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required       The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least    seconds  especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty  before eating and after blowing ones nose       The CDC recommends using an alcohol based hand sanitiser with at least     alcohol  but only when soap and water are not readily available       For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available  the WHO provides two formulations for local production  In these formulations  the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol  Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol  it is  not an active substance for hand antisepsis   Glycerol is added as a humectant        Surface cleaning After being expelled from the body  coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days   If a person touches the dirty surface  they may deposit the virus at the eyes  nose  or mouth where it can enter the body cause infection      Current evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of Covid          leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes            If surface contamination is a significant concern  a deep clean procedure may be used   The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface  the temperature  and the humidity       Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight       Like other enveloped viruses  SARS CoV   survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower  and when the relative humidity is low              On many surfaces  including as glass  some types of plastic  stainless steel  and skin  the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature  or even about a week under ideal conditions       On others  such as books  the virus may be able to survive for a couple of days       On some surfaces  including cotton fabric and copper  the virus usually dies after a few hours       As a general rule of thumb  the virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non porous surfaces       However  this rule is not absolute  and of the many surfaces tested  two with the longest survival times are N   respirator masks and surgical masks  both of which are considered porous surfaces       Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions  within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface   including   –   percent ethanol    –    percent isopropanol      percent sodium hypochlorite      percent hydrogen peroxide  and    –    percent povidone iodine  Other solutions  such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate  are less effective  Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used       The CDC recommends that if a COVID    case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care  all areas such as offices  bathrooms  common areas  shared electronic equipment like tablets  touch screens  keyboards  remote controls  and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected       A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry  including suspension or surface tested  kind of surface  use dilution  disinfectant and inocuylum volumes  can be seen in the supplementary material of        Ventilation and air filtration The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols                  Healthy diet and lifestyle The Harvard T H  Chan School of Public Health recommends a healthy diet  being physically active  managing psychological stress  and getting enough sleep       While there is no evidence that vitamin D is an effective treatment for COVID     there is limited evidence that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of severe COVID    symptoms       This has led to recommendations for individuals with vitamin D deficiency to take vitamin D supplements as a way of mitigating the risk of COVID    and other health issues associated with a possible increase in deficiency due to social distancing        Treatment Main article  Treatment and management of COVID     An overview of COVID    therapeutics and drugs   There is no specific  effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease       COVID      the disease caused by the SARS CoV   virus            Thus  the cornerstone of management of COVID    is supportive care  which includes treatment to relieve symptoms  fluid therapy  oxygen support and prone positioning as needed  and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs                 Most cases of COVID    are mild  In these  supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms  fever  body aches  cough   proper intake of fluids  rest  and nasal breathing                      Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended       The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask       People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital  In those with low oxygen levels  use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended  as it can reduce the risk of death                 Noninvasive ventilation and  ultimately  admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing       Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO  has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure  but its benefits are still under consideration             Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinical trials       Others were thought to be promising early in the pandemic  such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir ritonavir  but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful                 Despite ongoing research  there is still not enough high quality evidence to recommend so called early treatment            Nevertheless  in the United States  two monoclonal antibody based therapies are available for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease       The antiviral remdesivir is available in the U S   Canada  Australia  and several other countries  with varying restrictions  however  it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation  and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization  WHO        due to limited evidence of its efficacy       Prognosis See also  COVID    pandemic death rates by country  The severity of diagnosed COVID    cases in China      The severity of COVID    varies  The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms  resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold  In  –   of cases       for those over age     symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization       Mild cases typically recover within two weeks  while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover  Among those who have died  the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks      The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days  with seven being hospitalised  However  people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death       Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID    and with a transfer to ICU            Some early studies suggest     to     of people with COVID    will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month            A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath       On    October      WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that  to a significant number of people  the COVID virus poses a range of serious long term effects   He has described the vast spectrum of COVID    symptoms that fluctuate over time as  really concerning   They range from fatigue  a cough and shortness of breath  to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart  and also neurological and psychologic effects  Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body  Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue  headaches  months of complete exhaustion  mood swings  and other symptoms  Tedros has concluded that therefore herd immunity is  morally unconscionable and unfeasible        In terms of hospital readmissions about    of         individuals had to return for hospital treatment within   months of discharge  The average to readmit was   days since first hospital visit  There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility  Among these are advanced age  above    years of age  and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes  COPD  heart failure or chronic kidney disease            According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non smokers            air pollution is similarly associated with risk factors       and pre existing heart and lung diseases      and also obesity contributes to an increased health risk of COVID                    It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS CoV         One research that looked into the COVID    infections in hospitalized kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of            See also  Impact of the COVID    pandemic on children Children make up a small proportion of reported cases  with about    of cases being under    years and    aged   –   years      They are likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease than adults  A European multinational study of hospitalized children published in The Lancet on    June      found that about    of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care  Four of those     children        died  but the actual mortality rate could be  substantially lower  since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study       Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease  For instance  those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID               Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes       Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID    infection based on data from other similar viruses  like SARS and MERS  but data for COVID    is lacking             Complications  Mechanisms of SARS CoV   cytokine storm and complications Complications may include pneumonia  ARDS  multi organ failure  septic shock  and death       Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure  arrhythmias  heart inflammation  and blood clots       Approximately   –    of people who present with COVID    have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury            Neurologic manifestations include seizure  stroke  encephalitis  and Guillain–Barré syndrome  which includes loss of motor functions             Following the infection  children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome  which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease  which can be fatal            In very rare cases  acute encephalopathy can occur  and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID    and have an altered mental status        Longer term effects Main article  Long COVID Some early studies           suggest between   in   and   in    people with COVID    will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month  A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath       By a variety of mechanisms  the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID          The majority of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities in people tested after    days of illness       People with advanced age  severe disease  prolonged ICU stays  or who smoke are more likely to have long lasting effects  including pulmonary fibrosis       Overall  approximately one third of those investigated after   weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO  even in people who are asymptomatic  but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time        Immunity See also  COVID    vaccine  Human antibody response to SARS CoV   infection The immune response by humans to CoV   virus occurs as a combination of the cell mediated immunity and antibody production       just as with most other infections       Since SARS CoV   has been in the human population only since December       it remains unknown if the immunity is long lasting in people who recover from the disease       The presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection  but the level of neutralizing antibody declines with time  Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection  In another study  the level of neutralizing antibody fell   fold   to   months after the onset of symptoms  However  the lack of antibody in the blood does not mean antibody will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS CoV    Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS CoV   last for at least   months after appearance of symptoms       Nevertheless     cases of reinfection with SARS CoV   have been reported using stringent CDC criteria requiring identification of a different variant from the second infection  There are likely to be many more people who have been reinfected with the virus  Herd immunity will not eliminate the virus if reinfection is common       Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year        Mortality Main articles  COVID    pandemic and COVID    pandemic death rates by country Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality       These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing  healthcare system quality  treatment options  time since the initial outbreak  and population characteristics such as age  sex  and overall health       The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group  Consequently  the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population  Mortality rates are highly correlated to age  with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly                 The case fatality rate  CFR  reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval  Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics  the global death to case ratio is                              as of    February          The number varies by region            The CFR may not reflect the true severity of the disease  because some infected individuals remain asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms  and hence such infections may not be included in official case reports  Moreover  the CFR may vary markedly over time and across locations due to the availability of live virus tests       Total confirmed cases over time       Total confirmed cases of COVID    per million people            Total deaths over time       Total confirmed deaths due to COVID    per million people          Infection fatality rate A key metric in gauging the severity of COVID    is the infection fatality rate  IFR   also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk                 This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals  hence  in contrast to the CFR  the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases        Current estimates  The red line shows the estimate of infection fatality rate  IFR   in percentage terms  as a function of age  The shaded region depicts the     confidence interval for that estimate  Markers denotes specific observations used in the meta analysis        The same relationship plotted on a log scale A recent  Dec       systematic review and meta analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about      to    in many locations  including France  Netherlands  New Zealand  and Portugal      to    in other locations  Australia  England  Lithuania  and Spain   and exceeded    in Italy       That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age specific infection rates  in particular  the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults  e g          at age    and       at age     but increases progressively to      at age          at age          at age     and     at age          These results were also highlighted in a December      report issued by the WHO        Earlier estimates of IFR At an early stage of the pandemic  the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between      and               On   July  The WHOs chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two day WHO expert forum was about                 In August  the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately    –         Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate  As of    July  in New York City  with a population of     million         individuals         confirmed and       probable  have died with COVID          of the population        Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of             and             In Bergamo province       of the population has died       In September      the U S  Center for Disease Control   Prevention reported preliminary estimates of age specific IFRs

impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and Italy                 The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was      for men and      for women       Later reviews in June      indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders            One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men  suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors       Sex based immunological differences  lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men       In Europe      of the infected people were men and     of those died with COVID    were men       As of April       the US government is not tracking sex related data of COVID    infections       Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola  HIV  influenza and SARS affect men and women differently        Ethnic differences In the US  a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID    have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups       Structural factors that prevent them from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in  essential  occupations such as retail grocery workers  public transit employees  health care workers and custodial staff   Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes  hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death       Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities       According to a US health policy non profit      of American Indian and Alaska Native People  AIAN  non elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to     of white non elderly adults       The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water       Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities       In the U K   a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID    have occurred in those of a Black  Asian  and other ethnic minority background                 More severe impacts upon victims including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalization requirements  and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region    features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage  That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease       The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Karolinska Institutet       This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between        and        years ago in Southern Europe        Comorbidities Most of those who die of COVID    have pre existing  underlying  conditions  including hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and cardiovascular disease       According to March data from the United States      of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions       The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of      of deaths where medical charts were available        of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having     diseases       According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension      of deaths   type   diabetes        of deaths   Ischemic Heart Disease        of deaths   atrial fibrillation        of deaths  and chronic renal failure        of deaths   Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the CDC  are  moderate or severe asthma  pre existing COPD  pulmonary fibrosis  cystic fibrosis       Evidence stemming from meta analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes            When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID     they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms       COVID    also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines  insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage       In August      the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death  The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases  as testing positive for COVID    couldnt rule out co infections  Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in     million additional TB cases and     million TB related deaths by             Name During the initial outbreak in Wuhan  China  the virus and disease were commonly referred to as  coronavirus  and  Wuhan coronavirus                  with the disease sometimes called  Wuhan pneumonia             In the past  many diseases have been named after geographical locations  such as the Spanish flu       Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  and Zika virus       In January       the WHO recommended      nCov      and      nCoV acute respiratory disease      as interim names for the virus and disease per      guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations  e g  Wuhan  China   animal species  or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma                 The official names COVID    and SARS CoV   were issued by the WHO on    February            Tedros Adhanom explained  CO for corona  VI for virus  D for disease and    for when the outbreak was first identified     December             The WHO additionally uses  the COVID    virus  and  the virus responsible for COVID     in public communications        History Main article  Timeline of the COVID    pandemic The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin      through spillover infection       There are several theories about where the first case  the so called patient zero  originated       Phylogenetics estimates that SARS CoV   arose in October or November                      Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host       The first known human infections were in Wuhan  Hubei  China  A study of the first    cases of confirmed COVID     published in January      in The Lancet  reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as   December                      Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as   December            Human to human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by    January                 According to official Chinese sources  these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market  which also sold live animals       In May       George Gao  the director of the CDC  said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus  indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event  but it was not the site of the initial outbreak       Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin  Italy  on    December            By December       the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human to human transmission            The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased  reaching    by    December      and at least     by    December       On    December  Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  BAL  sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals  On    and    December  Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test  showing a new coronavirus       A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on    December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital  who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on    December       On    December  a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital  from company CapitalBio Medlab  stated an erroneous positive result for SARS  causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result  That evening  the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on  the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause        Eight of these doctors  including Li Wenliang  punished on   January        were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours  and another  Ai Fen  was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm       The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on    December  confirming    cases               —enough to trigger an investigation       During the early stages of the outbreak  the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days       In early and mid January       the virus spread to other Chinese provinces  helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange      On    January  China reported nearly     new cases in one day  including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen       Later official data shows       people had already developed symptoms by then       and more may have been infected       A report in The Lancet on    January indicated human transmission  strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers  and said testing for the virus was essential due to its  pandemic potential            On    January  the WHO declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern       By this time  the outbreak spread by a factor of     to     times       On    January       Italy had its first confirmed cases  two tourists from China       As of    March       the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic       On    March       Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths       By    March  the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world       Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID    cases in New York came from European travellers  rather than directly from China or any other Asian country       Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on    December                and a person in the United States who died from the disease on   February            On    June       after    days without a locally transmitted case       Beijing reported the first COVID    case  followed by two more cases on    June       By    June    cases were officially confirmed       Most of these people went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market            RT PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS CoV   as early as November and December       respectively  but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised  many have not been peer reviewed  details are often missing  and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected       A September      review journal article said   The possibility that the COVID    infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant  even if partially circumstantial  evidence   including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December        Misinformation Main article  Misinformation related to the COVID    pandemic After the initial outbreak of COVID     misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin  scale  prevention  treatment  and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online                 In September       the U S  CDC published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States  but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood             Other animals Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals  a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis   Some pets  especially Cats and Ferrets  can catch this virus from infected humans       Symptoms in cats include respiratory  such as a cough  and digestive symptoms       Cats can spread the virus to other cats  and may be able to spread the virus to humans  but cat to human transmission of SARS CoV   has not been proven            Compared to cats  Dogs are less susceptible to this infection       Behaviors which increase the risk of transmission include kissing  licking  and petting the animal       The virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs  ducks  or Chickens at all       Mice  Rats  and Rabbits  if they can be infected at all  are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus       Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans       As expected  Monkeys and great ape species such as Orangutans can also be infected with the COVID    virus       Minks  which are in the same family as ferrets  have been infected       Minks may be asymptomatic  and can also spread the virus to humans       Multiple countries have identified infected animals in Mink farms       Denmark  a major producer of mink pelts  ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations       A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched        Research Further information  COVID    drug development International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID    is underway by government organisations  academic groups  and industry researchers            The CDC has classified it to require a BSL  grade laboratory       There has been a great deal of COVID    research  involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand       As of December      update   hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken  with research happening on every continent except Antarctica       As of November      update   more than     possible treatments had been studied in humans so far        Transmission and prevention research Further information  COVID    vaccine Modelling research has been conducted with several objectives  including predictions of the dynamics of transmission       diagnosis and prognosis of infection       estimation of the impact of interventions            or allocation of resources       Modelling studies are mostly based on epidemiological models       estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions  Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID    including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID          retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure       mobility data based models to investigate transmission       or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic       Further  conceptual frameworks from crisis management research have been applied to better understand the effects of COVID    on organizations worldwide             Treatment related research Main article  COVID    drug repurposing research  Seven possible drug targets in viral replication process and drugs Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID    treatments            Other candidates in trials include vasodilators  corticosteroids  immune therapies  lipoic acid  bevacizumab  and recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme         In March       the World Health Organization  WHO  initiated the Solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs   an experimental drug called remdesivir  anti malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  two anti HIV drugs  lopinavir ritonavir  and interferon beta            More than     active clinical trials were underway as of April            Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best            and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir        By May      update   France  Italy  and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID    treatment       In June  initial results from the randomised RECOVERY Trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen       Because this is a well tested and widely available treatment  it was welcomed by the WHO  which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids            Based on those preliminary results  dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID    who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID    who do not require supplemental oxygen       In September       the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID          The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID     strong recommendation  based on moderate certainty evidence        The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non severe COVID     conditional recommendation  based on low certainty evidence        The updated guidance was based on a meta analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID    patients            In September       the European Medicines Agency  EMA  endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least    kilograms     lb  who require supplemental oxygen therapy       Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion  drip  into a vein       In November       the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID          Bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive results of direct SARS CoV   viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least    kilograms     lb   and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID    or hospitalization       This includes those who are    years of age or older  or who have chronic medical conditions        Cytokine storm  Various therapeutic strategies for targeting cytokine storm  A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID     A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly  A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure       Data collected from Jin Yin tan Hospital in Wuhan  China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID    had greater amounts of pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses  These high levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm       Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by Chinas National Health Commission after a small study was completed            It is undergoing a Phase II non randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease            Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm  also called cytokine storm syndrome  not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome   it is meant to counter such developments  which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people       The interleukin   receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA to undergo a Phase III clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID    based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause  CAR T cell therapy  in            To date  when   there is no randomised  controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS  Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL   levels by saturating the IL  R  driving IL   across the blood brain barrier  and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of CRS       Lenzilumab  an anti GM CSF monoclonal antibody  is protective in murine models for CAR T cell induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM CSF secreting T cells in hospitalised patients with COVID           Passive antibodies  Overview of the application and use of convalescent plasma therapy Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID    to people who need them is being investigated as a non vaccine method of passive immunisation            Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS CoV    The spike protein of SARS CoV   is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies       As of   August       eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS CoV   have entered clinical studies       It has been proposed that selection of broad neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV   and SARS CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID    but also future SARS related CoV infections       Other mechanisms  however  such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and or phagocytosis  may be possible       Other forms of passive antibody therapy  for example  using manufactured monoclonal antibodies  are in development       The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID    is also being studied  This involves the production of convalescent serum  which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus  which is then administered to current patients       This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results       A Cochrane review in October      found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this treatment in COVID     due in large part to the methodology of the clinical trials conducted so far       Specifically  there are no trials yet conducted for which the safety of convalescent serum administration to people with COVID    can be determined  and the differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy        See also  COVID    portal
